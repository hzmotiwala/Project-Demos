## A/B Testing Checklist: Designing and Running an Experiment
A/B testing, also known as Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), is a powerful method used to compare two versions of a product or feature to determine which performs better. By randomly assigning participants to different groups and measuring the impact of variations, businesses can make data-driven decisions. This checklist will guide you through the essential steps of designing and running an A/B test, ensuring robust and reliable results.

### Design the Experiment
- Understand the Goal 
- Clearly define the objective of the experiment.
- Identify what you aim to learn or improve through the A/B test.
- Understand which metrics will be used to evaluate success of the experiment.
  - Primary Metric: The main metric you will use to measure success.
  - Driver Metrics: Secondary metrics that provide additional context.
  - Counter/Guardrail Metrics: Metrics to ensure the changes do not negatively impact other areas.
- Select the Audience
  - Determine the target population for the experiment.
  - Decide how participants will be randomly assigned to different groups.
### Document Evaluation Criteria
- Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE): Decide the smallest effect size that would be meaningful for your business.
- Sample Size Calculation: Calculate the number of participants required to achieve reliable results.
- Duration of Experiment: Estimate how long the experiment needs to run to gather sufficient data.
- Significance Level (p-value): Notate the p-value threshold for statistical significance (commonly 0.05).
- Statistical Power (Beta): Notate the beta level to determine the power of the test (commonly 0.8 or 80%).
- Variance of Metric: Calculate the variability of your primary metric.
- Confidence Interval: Notate the range within which the true effect size is expected to fall.
- Type of Test: Choose the appropriate statistical test (e.g., 2-sample t-test, chi-square test).
- Network Effects: Determine if there are any network effects that could influence the results.
### Run Experiment and Evaluate
- Bias Control: Ensure there is no bias from novelty, seasonality, or network effects.
- Group Size Consistency: Verify that the size of the groups is as expected or equal.
- A/A Test: Conduct an A/A test if necessary to ensure randomization is working correctly.
- Statistical Significance Check: Verify if the results are statistically significant.
- Practical Significance Check: Check if the results are meaningful in practical terms.
- Red Flag Identification: Identify any anomalies or unexpected results that could indicate issues with the experiment.
- Evaluation: Make a decision based on the analysis of the results, considering all metrics and potential impacts.

### By following this checklist, you can design and run A/B tests that provide reliable and actionable insights. Ensuring each step is thoroughly planned and executed helps minimize bias, improve accuracy, and ultimately drive better business decisions.
